Crafted as a bespoke project within the context of studying and exploring the expansive possibilities of React, this endeavor represents an E-commerce Single Page Application (SPA) functioning as a dynamic e-shop platform.

In this application, users have the ability to seamlessly create new products and categories, subsequently showcasing them on the website. Robust user authentication mechanisms, encompassing both sign-in and sign-up functionalities, have been implemented. Each user has it's own personalized portfolio page, affording them the convenience of reviewing and cataloging past purchases.

The payment infrastructure is facilitated through Stripe, strategically incorporated to optimize user transactions.

Notably, the absence of a traditional backend is compensated by leveraging server-side functions.

For persistent data storage, Firebase has been used, providing flexibility in constructing data structures and data architecture on the fly.

Beyond fundamental React functionalities, advanced features such as React Router, React Hooks, Context API, Redux-Saga, and GraphQL have been seamlessly integrated, elevating the overall performance and user experience.
Testing utilizing Jest ensures a reliable and robust application. With a future-oriented perspective, this project is poised for deployment as a Progressive Web App, aligning with industry standards.

While the majority of features have been implemented, it's worth noting that certain aspects are still a work in progress, reflecting an ongoing commitment to developmen and refinement of this App.
